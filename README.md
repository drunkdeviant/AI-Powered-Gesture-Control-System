Overview
--------
This project leverages computer vision and AI techniques to enable gesture-based control for a variety of tasks. The system uses a webcam to detect hand gestures and perform actions such as adjusting brightness and controlling audio volume. Future iterations will incorporate additional features to expand its functionality and enhance performance.

Technologies Used
-----------------
The project utilizes the following libraries and frameworks:

1.Python: Core programming language.

2.OpenCV: For real-time image processing and video capture.

3.Mediapipe: To detect and track hand landmarks.

4.NumPy: For numerical computations.

5.Screen Brightness Control: To dynamically adjust screen brightness.

6.PyCaw: For controlling audio system settings.

Usage
-----
1.Ensure your webcam is connected and enabled.

2.Run the script to launch the gesture recognition system.

3.Use gestures to:

  Adjust screen brightness.
  
  Control audio volume.
  
4.Press Esc to exit the application.

Future Enhancements
-------------------
1.Mouse Control: Integrating gesture-based pointer movement.

2.Security Pattern Recognition: Using hand gestures as a unique authentication mechanism.

3.Performance Metrics: Adding algorithms to test and optimize system performance.
